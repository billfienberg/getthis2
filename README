GetThis2

GetThis2 is a community shopping list. It allows for a group of individuals, in a house for example, to have a list where they can all contribute. 

The needs of the group are available to all members at all times without the need for calling, texting, emailing, etc. 

GetThis2 incorporates two API's: GitHub login and Google Web Speech.

These two API's allow the application to authenticate the user and allows the user to use their voice to add content.
